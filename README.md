<p align="center"><b>STOREOPEDIA</b>-<i>The Encyclopedia of Stores</i></p>

<b>Idea</b>
<p>An android application that aims to reduce the unnecessary movement of citizens during the period of lockdown and promote social 
distancing. The movement of people to get essential goods like groceries and medicines cannot be stopped completely. During the lockdown 
period, the opening times of local stores are uncertain. People going to stores to get their necessities only to find it closed is just an 
unnecessary movement. Also because of a very small window for which the stores are open, they attract a crowd at once. This app aims to 
fight these kind of challenges. </p>


<b>Functionalities</b>
<p>At present, the application provides a real-time update for the opening and closing time of the local stores which is controlled at the 
shopkeepers' end. A customer gets the basic information of the stores currently open in his locality and some basic information about the 
shop. A map view is provided in the application for easy identification, location and navigation of the stores.</p>


<b>Future Development Features</b>
<p>1. To integrate a chat system such that the customers can place their orders through the app and delivery time is allocated to them such
that the crowd is as less as possible.</p>
<p>2. Addition of online payment gateways in the app to promote the contactless transfer of money.</p>
<p>3. Use of google maps instead of mapbox which is currently being used to get a more detailed map-view.</p>
